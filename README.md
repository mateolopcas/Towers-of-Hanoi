# Towers-of-Hanoi

## Description

A Towers of Hanoi game to be played in the DOM coded in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I wanted to challenge myself with a game that required both logic and user interface elements like drag events.
I wrote it initially using a point-and-click method to play the game. After I had proper game logic, I researched HTML drag events and rewrote my code using them.

## Installation/Usage
